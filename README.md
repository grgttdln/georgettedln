> <b>Where could the concepts discussed in class be seen in your website?</b>

> [!NOTE]  
> In HTML, I used various tags to solidify the structure of my webpage portfolio. The concepts discussed in class are reflected in the structure of my webpage portfolio through the strategic use of HTML tags. These tags serve as the building blocks that shape the layout and organization of content on the site. For instance, the <header>, <nav>, <div>, and <footer> tags contribute to a well-structured design. Hence, the application of these HTML elements ensures that the fundamental principles I learned in class, including the document structure and semantic markup, are implemented in the creation of this project.
>
> The visual appeal of my webpage portfolio is enhanced through the application of CSS (Cascading Style Sheets). CSS plays a role in defining the aesthetics and layout of the content on my site. By utilizing CSS properties and selectors, I am able to customize the appearance of HTML elements, specifying aspects like color, font, spacing, and positioning. Selectors like class and ID enable targeted styling. Furtermore, media queries in CSS further ensure a responsive design that adapts to various device screens. In addition, animations in css bring dynamic flare and interactive elements to my webpage. The integration of CSS in my webpage not only adds a layer of creativity but also reflects a mastery of styling concepts acquired in class, contributing to an engaging and visually pleasing user experience.
>
> Lastly, the interactivity and dynamic behavior of my webpage portfolio are achieved through the integration of JavaScript. JavaScript adds a layer of functionality by allowing for the manipulation of HTML elements and the handling of user interactions. 
>
> In summary, my webpage portfolio is thoughtfully crafted using the concepts discussed in class as HTML is for structure, CSS is for aesthetics and layout customization, and JavaScript is for interactivity. This comprehensive approach demonstrates mt strong understanding of web development principles.

> <b>What was your inspiration for the design of the website?</b>

> [!NOTE]  
> My inspiration for the design of my website is my own personal style and preferences. I incorporated elements that resonate with my taste to make it more authentic. Furthermore, I applied UX principles to ensure that my website is not only visually appealing but also prioritizing intuitive user experience.
> 
> I am also inspired by the portfolio websites from Bryl Lim and Brittany Chiang who are both software engineers that I look up to. What I like about their sites is the comprehensive information, concise layout, and the interactive features included. Their portfolio sites gave me an insight into how others present their professional work and credentials.

> <b>What was your approach in creating the content of the website?</b>

> [!NOTE]  
> My first approach in creating the content of the website is to identify what to be included. I identified an about me, toolkit, projects, certifications, and contact components to be the main sections of my website. Then, I started to rapidly conceptualize the layout of the page through pen and paper. After which, I worked on deciding the main fonts, colors, and elements that will be used in the website portfolio. Then, I gathered the information that will be included in each section. Succeeding this, I then finalize the arrangement of the layout, elements, and information of my web portfolio. Afterwards, I started coding the site.

> <b>How is your website creative?</b>

> [!NOTE]  
> I can say my web portfolio is creative as it has unique design that reflects me. I use color schemes, typography, and layouts that reflect my personal style. Overall, the design I aligned my site with is minimalist. I also incorporated interactive elements. I included animated graphics, hover effects, and interactive buttons throughout the page. Moreover, I used visuals to tell a story about myself, skills, projects, and certifications. With this I included high-quality images that showcase the mentioned sections of the page. Furthermore, instead of simply listing my projects, I presented them in an innovative way. I utilize creative layout of the projects, including each project's screenshots, and provided a link that leads to the actual project where an in-depth project presentation is presented. In addition, I highlighted my toolkit and skills in an interactive style though icons and animations. I also displayed my certifications in a visually appealing and neat manner. Moreover, I made my contact page more inviting. I used a creative contact form that includes a link to my email through which they can contact me. I also considered adding a personalized message to encourage people to reach out. Lastly, I maintained a consistent branding throughout my website portfolio. Consistency helps in creating a cohesive and professional look.

> <b>What did you use to deploy your website?</b>

> [!NOTE]  
> I use GitHub Pages to deploy my portfolio website. GitHub Pages is one of the features in GitHub as it is a static site hosting service that takes HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files straight from a repository on GitHub and published it. It allows users to host static websites free of charge. Also, deploying sites is easy in GitHub Pages.

> <b>Insights that you have gathered while accomplishing LT0, LT1, and M1M2 (Guided Exercise 1)</b>

> [!NOTE]  
> I have learned essential tools like Git and GitHub. With Git, I have learned how to track changes in my codebase, create branches for new features or bug fixes, and collaborate seamlessly with others. On the other hand, GitHub provides a platform for hosting my repositories and facilitating collaboration with others. Moreover, GitHub Pages, which is part of GitHub allows me to host static websites directly from my repositories, enabling me to display my projects or documentation effortlessly.  
>
> Moreover, I learned the structures of HTML, CSS, and a bit of JavaScript. HTML is crucial for web development. I have gained proficiency in creating the backbone of web pages, structuring content with elements like headings, paragraphs, lists, div, and more. My favorite HTML tag is the div tag. I have gained proficiency in the strategic use of the div tag, allowing me to group and structure content for styling or layout purposes. My proficiency in using the div elements suggests that I can create modular and maintainable code, making it easier to apply CSS styles and enhance the overall presentation of my web pages. 
>
> With CSS, I have delved into styling and layout. I learned how to apply styles to HTML elements, control layout with positioning and flexbox/grid, and make my websites visually appealing. The knowledge I have gained in CSS allows me to create responsive and aesthetically pleasing user interfaces. 
>
> Lastly, JavaScript is a powerful programming language for web development. I have learned to create dynamic and interactive web pages.

> <b>Struggles that you have encountered while accomplishing LT0, LT1, and M1M2 (Guided Exercise 1)</b>

> [!NOTE]  
> The challenges I faced are getting accustomed to the syntax of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Moreover, I have trouble in CSS particularly in styling consistency across different browsers. Achieving consistent styling across different browsers is challenging due to varying interpretations of CSS properties and rendering engines. Furthermore, I encountered hurdles in responsive designs, specially creating web sites that adapt to different screen sizes. 
>
> However, these challenges are part of the learning process. Consistent practice, hands-on coding, and seeking help from online resources, tutorials, and community forums helped me to overcome these struggles.

> [!IMPORTANT]  
> <b>How you could improve your website in the future?</b>

> [!NOTE]  
> I could improve my website in the future by gathering feedback on my website to gather insights from users. The information collected on what design and layout works and cannot enhance the overall website. Thus, I can improve on the areas that need improvement. Moreover, as I take on new projects and gain additional certifications, I can update my portfolio to highlight my latest work and achievements. This not only keeps my website current but also demonstrates my continuous growth. But most importantly, as new devices and screen sizes emerge, I must ensure that my website remains fully responsive. The website must be tested further on various devices to guarantee a consistent and user-friendly experience. Lastly, I must enhance the accessibility of my website by addressing any issues that may arise. Therefore, I must ensure that it is usable by individuals with disabilities, conforming to accessibility standards.
